## Getting Started
1. **Check :**
  ```sh
  üö® Please check that you have mlxlib installed in your machine.
  ```
2. **Install mlxlib**
  If you don't have mlxlib installed, follow these steps:
    - For macOS:
    ```sh
      tar -xvzf minilibx_mac.tgz
      cd minilibx_opengl_20191021
      make
    ```
    - For Linux:
    ```sh
      tar -xvzf minilibx-linux.tgz
      cd minilibx-linux
      make
    ```
3. **Clone the Repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/haytham-hammioui/42_So_Long_1337.git so_long
   ```
4. **Ensure Correct Path to `mlx.h`**
   Make sure that the path to the MiniLibX header file (`mlx.h`) is correctly set in your project files. If `mlx.h` is located in a custom path,
   you can specify it as follows:
     - In so_long.h or so_long_bonus.h:
     ```sh
     # include "/path/to/your/mlx.h"
     ```
### Usage
To use `So_long` :
  ```sh
  cd so_long
  cd mandatory or bonus
  make
  ```
To run the game, provide a valid map file with the .ber extension :
  ```sh
  mandatory : ./so_long [map_file.ber]
  bonus : ./so_long_bonus [map_file.ber]
  ```
Only map files with the .ber extension are supported. Example map files can be found in the maps/ directory.

For instance, to run the game with a sample map:
  ```sh
  ./so_long maps/map1.ber
  ./so_long_bonus maps/map1.ber
  ```
### HOW TO PLAY
The player‚Äôs goal is to collect all collectibles present on the map then escape with minimal movement.
